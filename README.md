# Bolt-OAuth
A library to assist you with OAuth when using Slack's [Bolt](https://slack.dev/bolt) framework.

# Install

`npm install bolt-oauth`

# Usage

The library might seem complicated at first, but it's really not!

### Step 1: Setup Callback Functions
First, you need to create some callback functions for the OAuth events.

##### Success Callback
This is for when the OAuth was successful and nothing went wrong!

```
const oauthSuccess = ({ res, oAuthResult }) => {
  // save oAuthResult in MongoDB or somewhere else permanent since it has all the tokens
    res.redirect('<successfully_installed_thankyou_page_url>');
};
```
- `res` is an ExpressJS response object
- `oAuthResult` is the result from the Slack OAuth call with all the good stuff you need

A sample `oAuthResult` is
```
{
    ok: true,
    access_token: 'xoxp-12345678901-234567890123-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdef',
    scope: 'identify,bot,commands',
    user_id: 'U12345678',
    team_id: 'T12345678',
    enterprise_id: null,
    team_name: 'Sopinka Inc.',
    bot: {
        bot_user_id: 'U90123456',
        bot_access_token: 'xoxb-12345678901-456789012345-ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijkl'
    },
    response_metadata: {}
}
```

##### Error Callback
This is for when the OAuth throws an error at any point.

```
const oauthError = (error) => {
    // do something about that error to let the user know
};
```

##### State Check
You'll want to implement this function if you're doing a state check on OAuth to prevent XSRF attacks. If you're not already, you'll want to do this as a best practice.

```
const oauthStateCheck = (oAuthState) => {
    // check the parameter state against your saved state to ensure everything is ok
    return true;
};
```

##### Authorize
Since you've got distribution on, and multiple teams using your app, you'll need to implement a custom authorize function, as outlined on the [official documentation](https://slack.dev/bolt/concepts#authorization).

```
const authorizeFn = ({ teamId, enterpriseId, userId, conversationId }) => {
    // go to your MongoDB or wherever you've stored the tokens and get the values based on teamId and/or userId
    return <your_tokens>;
};
```
`<your_tokens>` will need to be an object formatted something like this:
```
return {
    userToken: team.userToken,
    botToken: team.botToken,
    botId: team.botId,
    botUserId: team.botUserId
 }
```

### Step 2: Implement into your Bolt app
Now the fun stuff! Require the library and modify your Bolt `App` constructor to look something like this:

```
const { App } = require('@slack/bolt');
const Auth = require('bolt-oauth');

const app = new App({
    authorize: authorizeFn,
    receiver: Auth({
        clientId: process.env.SLACK_CLIENT_ID,
        clientSecret: process.env.SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET,
        signingSecret: process.env.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET,
        redirectUrl: process.env.SLACK_REDIRECT_URL,
        stateCheck: oauthStateCheck,
        onSuccess: oauthSuccess,
        onError: oauthError,
        useSlackOauthV2: <true or false>
    })
});
```
- The environment variables above should be self-explanatory.
- All fields are **required** except
-- `useSlackOauthV2` which is true/false depending on whether you want to use the old Slack OAuth or the new V2 OAuth with granular scopes. Defaults to `false` if omitted.

### Step 3: Celebrate ðŸŽ‰

That's it! You're all set! Now submit your app to the Slack App Directory and share your creation with the world!
